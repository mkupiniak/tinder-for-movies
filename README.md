# Tinder for movies

I assume the title is self-explanatory ;)

This project was built with Angular2. It uses RxJS, SCSS, TypeScript and HammerJS for touch detection.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
